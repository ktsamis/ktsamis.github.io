Open source refers to a development model where the source code of a piece of software is made freely available to the public. Linux, on the other hand, is an open-source operating system that was first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.
Since then, Linux has become one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, powering everything from supercomputers and data centers to smartphones and embedded systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
